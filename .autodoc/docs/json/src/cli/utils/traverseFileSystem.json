  "summary": "The `traverseFileSystem` function is a utility function that recursively traverses a file system starting from a given input path. It takes in an object of parameters that include the input path, the name of the project, functions to process files and folders, and an array of patterns to ignore. \n\nThe function first checks if the input path exists and logs an error message if it does not. It then defines a helper function `shouldIgnore` that takes in a file name and returns a boolean indicating whether the file should be ignored based on the ignore patterns provided. \n\nThe main recursive traversal is done using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm implemented in the `dfs` function. It first reads the contents of the current directory using the `readdir` method of the `fs` module and filters out any files that should be ignored using the `shouldIgnore` function. It then processes each folder and file in the contents array using `Promise.all` to run them concurrently. \n\nFor each folder, it recursively calls the `dfs` function with the folder path and processes the folder using the `processFolder` function if it is provided. The `processFolder` function is passed an object containing the folder name, folder path, project name, and the `shouldIgnore` function. \n\nFor each file, it checks if it is a text file using the `isText` function from the `istextorbinary` module. If it is a text file, it processes the file using the `processFile` function if it is provided. The `processFile` function is passed an object containing the file name, file path, and project name. \n\nThe function catches any errors that occur during traversal and logs an error message before re-throwing the error. \n\nThis function can be used in the larger autodoc project to recursively traverse a project directory and process each file and folder according to the needs of the project. For example, it could be used to extract documentation from each file and generate a documentation website for the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { traverseFileSystem } from 'autodoc';\n\nconst processFile = async ({ fileName, filePath, projectName }) => {\n  console.log(`Processing file ${fileName} in project ${projectName} at path ${filePath}`);\n  // Process file here\n};\n\nconst processFolder = async ({ folderName, folderPath, projectName }) => {\n  console.log(`Processing folder ${folderName} in project ${projectName} at path ${folderPath}`);\n  // Process folder here\n};\n\nconst ignore = ['node_modules', '.git'];\n\nawait traverseFileSystem({\n  inputPath: '/path/to/project',\n  projectName: 'My Project',\n  processFile,\n  processFolder,\n  ignore,\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a function called `traverseFileSystem` that recursively traverses a file system starting from a given path and performs certain actions on files and folders based on provided parameters.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies: `node:fs/promises` for file system operations, `path` for path manipulation, `minimatch` for pattern matching, and `istextorbinary` for determining if a file is text or binary.\n\n3. What are the parameters that can be passed to the `traverseFileSystem` function?\n- The `traverseFileSystem` function takes an object parameter called `params` that can contain the following properties: `inputPath` (string), `projectName` (string), `processFile` (function), `processFolder` (function), and `ignore` (array of strings). These parameters are used to customize the behavior of the file system traversal and the actions performed on files and folders."
