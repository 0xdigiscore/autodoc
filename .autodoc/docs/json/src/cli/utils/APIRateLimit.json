  "summary": "The `APIRateLimit` class is designed to limit the number of concurrent API calls made by an application. It achieves this by queuing up API calls that exceed the maximum number of concurrent calls allowed and executing them as soon as there are available slots. \n\nThe class has two private properties: `queue` and `inProgress`. The `queue` property is an array that holds functions that represent API calls waiting to be executed. The `inProgress` property is a counter that keeps track of the number of API calls currently being executed. \n\nThe constructor takes an optional parameter `maxConcurrentCalls` that specifies the maximum number of concurrent API calls allowed. If no value is provided, the default value of 50 is used. \n\nThe `callApi` method is the main method of the class. It takes a function that returns a promise as its argument. This function represents the API call that needs to be made. The method returns a promise that resolves with the result of the API call. \n\nWhen the `callApi` method is called, it creates a new promise that is returned to the caller. It then creates a new function called `executeCall` that represents the API call. This function increments the `inProgress` counter, makes the API call, and resolves the promise with the result. If there is an error, the promise is rejected with the error. Finally, the `inProgress` counter is decremented, and the `dequeueAndExecute` method is called to execute the next API call in the queue. \n\nThe `executeCall` function is then pushed onto the `queue` array. If there are available slots for concurrent calls, the `dequeueAndExecute` method is called immediately to execute the API call. \n\nThe `dequeueAndExecute` method is a private method that executes API calls in the queue as long as there are available slots for concurrent calls. It does this by looping through the `queue` array and executing the next API call in the queue if there are available slots. \n\nOverall, the `APIRateLimit` class provides a simple way to limit the number of concurrent API calls made by an application. It can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the `autodoc` project to ensure that API calls are made efficiently and without overwhelming the API server. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst apiRateLimit = new APIRateLimit(10);\n\nasync function makeApiCall() {\n  const result = await apiRateLimit.callApi(() => {\n    return fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n  });\n  console.log(result);\n}\n\nmakeApiCall(); // This will execute immediately if there are less than 10 API calls in progress. Otherwise, it will be added to the queue and executed when there are available slots.\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `APIRateLimit` that limits the number of concurrent API calls that can be made at once.\n\n2. How does this code handle errors?\n- If an error occurs while making an API call, the `callApi` method will reject the promise with the error.\n\n3. Can the maximum number of concurrent calls be changed after the `APIRateLimit` object is created?\n- No, the maximum number of concurrent calls is set in the constructor and cannot be changed afterwards."
