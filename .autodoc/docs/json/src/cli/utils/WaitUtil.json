  "summary": "The code in this file provides two utility functions, `wait` and `forTrue`, that are designed to help manage asynchronous operations in the Clockwork project. These functions return Promises, which are a standard way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.\n\n### wait function\n\nThe `wait` function is an asynchronous function that takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the Promise, and `value`, which is an optional value to be returned when the Promise resolves. The default value for `value` is `null`.\n\nThis function can be used to introduce a delay in the execution of asynchronous code. For example, if you want to wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) before executing the next line of code, you can use the `wait` function as follows:\n\n```javascript\nawait wait(1000);\nconsole.log(\"This will be printed after 1 second\");\n```\n\n### forTrue function\n\nThe `forTrue` function is another asynchronous utility function that takes a single argument, `fn`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The purpose of this function is to repeatedly check the result of the `fn` function every 50 milliseconds, up to a maximum of 200 times. If the `fn` function returns `true` at any point during this process, the Promise resolves with the value `true`. If the `fn` function never returns `true` after 200 checks, the Promise is rejected.\n\nThis function can be used to wait for a specific condition to become true before proceeding with the execution of asynchronous code. For example, if you have a function `isDataReady` that returns `true` when some data is ready to be processed, you can use the `forTrue` function as follows:\n\n```javascript\nawait forTrue(isDataReady);\nconsole.log(\"Data is ready, proceed with processing\");\n```\n\nIn summary, this file provides two utility functions that help manage asynchronous operations in the Clockwork project by introducing delays and waiting for specific conditions to be met.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `wait` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer:** The `wait` function is an asynchronous utility function that resolves a promise after a specified timeout in milliseconds. It takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait, and an optional `value` to be resolved with the promise.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `forTrue` function work and what is its use case?\n   **Answer:** The `forTrue` function is an asynchronous utility function that repeatedly checks if a given function `fn` returns `true`. It resolves a promise when the function returns `true` or rejects the promise if the function does not return `true` after 200 attempts with a 50ms interval between each attempt.\n\n3. **Question:** Why is the `count` variable initialized to 0 in the `forTrue` function but never incremented?\n   **Answer:** It seems to be a mistake in the code. The `count` variable should be incremented within the `setInterval` callback to keep track of the number of attempts made to check if the function `fn` returns `true`."
