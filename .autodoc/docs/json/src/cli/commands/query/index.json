  "summary": "The `query` function in this file is a chatbot that can answer questions related to a codebase. It takes in two arguments: `AutodocRepoConfig` and `AutodocUserConfig`. The `AutodocRepoConfig` object contains information about the repository, such as the name and URL, while the `AutodocUserConfig` object contains information about the user, such as their preferred language model. \n\nThe chatbot uses the `inquirer` package to prompt the user for a question related to the codebase. It then uses the `makeChain` function from the `createChatChain.js` file to generate a response to the question. The `makeChain` function takes in the name of the repository, the repository URL, a vector store, a language model, and a callback function. It returns a function that can be called with a question and chat history, and it generates a response to the question using the vector store and language model.\n\nThe chatbot displays the response to the user using the `marked` package to format the response as Markdown. It also keeps track of the chat history in an array called `chatHistory`.\n\nThe chatbot runs in a loop until the user types \"exit\". It prompts the user for a question, generates a response, displays the response, and repeats until the user types \"exit\".\n\nThis chatbot can be used as a tool to help users understand a codebase. It uses natural language processing to generate responses to questions, and it can be customized with different language models and vector stores. It also keeps track of chat history, which can be useful for debugging or improving the chatbot's responses over time. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { query } from 'autodoc';\n\nconst repoConfig = {\n  name: 'my-project',\n  repositoryUrl: 'https://github.com/my-username/my-project',\n  output: '/path/to/output',\n};\n\nconst userConfig = {\n  llms: 'en',\n};\n\nquery(repoConfig, userConfig);\n```\n\nThis will start the chatbot for the `my-project` repository using the English language model. The user can then ask questions related to the codebase, and the chatbot will generate responses.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `query` function?\n- The `query` function is used to run a chatbot that can answer questions related to a codebase.\n\n2. What is the `vectorStore` variable used for?\n- The `vectorStore` variable is used to store and load embeddings for the chatbot.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `chatHistory` array?\n- The `chatHistory` array is used to keep track of the chat history between the user and the chatbot."
