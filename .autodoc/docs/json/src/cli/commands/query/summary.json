      "summary": "The `makeChain` function in the `autodoc` project is responsible for creating a chatbot that can answer technical questions related to a software project. The chatbot is designed to be an AI assistant for a software project and is trained on all the code that makes up the project. The chatbot is created using several libraries and models, including `langchain/llms`, `langchain/chains`, `langchain/prompts`, `langchain/hnswlib.js`, and `types.js`.\n\nThe `makeChain` function takes several parameters, including the name of the project, the URL of the project's repository, a vector store, an array of LLM models, and an optional callback function. The function first selects an LLM model to use for generating responses. If there are multiple LLM models provided, it selects the second one if it exists, otherwise it selects the first one. \n\nThe function then creates a `questionGenerator` object using the selected LLM model and a `CONDENSE_PROMPT` template. The `CONDENSE_PROMPT` template is used to rephrase a follow-up question to be a standalone question. \n\nNext, the function creates a `QA_PROMPT` template using the `makeQAPrompt` function. The `QA_PROMPT` template is used to provide a conversational answer with hyperlinks back to GitHub. The template includes instructions for the chatbot on how to answer questions, including how to use the context to inform the answer and how to handle questions that are not related to the project.\n\nFinally, the function creates a `ChatVectorDBQAChain` object using the vector store, the `questionGenerator` object, and a `docChain` object. The `docChain` object is created using the `loadQAChain` function and an `OpenAIChat` object. The `OpenAIChat` object is used to generate responses to questions using the LLM model and the `QA_PROMPT` template. \n\nOverall, the `makeChain` function is a key component of the `autodoc` project, as it creates a chatbot that can answer technical questions related to a software project. The chatbot is designed to be an AI assistant for a software project and is trained on all the code that makes up the project. The chatbot is created using several libraries and models, including `langchain/llms`, `langchain/chains`, `langchain/prompts`, `langchain/hnswlib.js`, and `types.js`.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `autodoc` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- The code in this file is used to create a chatbot that can answer technical questions about a software project called `projectName`, using a combination of GPT-3 or GPT-4 and a vector database. The `autodoc` project likely involves automatically generating documentation for software projects.\n2. What is the significance of the `HNSWLib` and `LLMModels` imports?\n- The `HNSWLib` import is used to create a vector database for the chatbot to search through, while the `LLMModels` import is used to specify which language model to use for generating responses. \n3. What is the purpose of the `makeQAPrompt` function?\n- The `makeQAPrompt` function creates a prompt template that the chatbot will use to generate responses to questions about the `projectName` software project. The template includes instructions for how the response should be structured and what information it should include."

      "summary": "The `query` function in this file is a chatbot that can answer questions related to a codebase. It takes in two arguments: `AutodocRepoConfig` and `AutodocUserConfig`. The `AutodocRepoConfig` object contains information about the repository, such as the name and URL, while the `AutodocUserConfig` object contains information about the user, such as their preferred language model. \n\nThe chatbot uses the `inquirer` package to prompt the user for a question related to the codebase. It then uses the `makeChain` function from the `createChatChain.js` file to generate a response to the question. The `makeChain` function takes in the name of the repository, the repository URL, a vector store, a language model, and a callback function. It returns a function that can be called with a question and chat history, and it generates a response to the question using the vector store and language model.\n\nThe chatbot displays the response to the user using the `marked` package to format the response as Markdown. It also keeps track of the chat history in an array called `chatHistory`.\n\nThe chatbot runs in a loop until the user types \"exit\". It prompts the user for a question, generates a response, displays the response, and repeats until the user types \"exit\".\n\nThis chatbot can be used as a tool to help users understand a codebase. It uses natural language processing to generate responses to questions, and it can be customized with different language models and vector stores. It also keeps track of chat history, which can be useful for debugging or improving the chatbot's responses over time. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { query } from 'autodoc';\n\nconst repoConfig = {\n  name: 'my-project',\n  repositoryUrl: 'https://github.com/my-username/my-project',\n  output: '/path/to/output',\n};\n\nconst userConfig = {\n  llms: 'en',\n};\n\nquery(repoConfig, userConfig);\n```\n\nThis will start the chatbot for the `my-project` repository using the English language model. The user can then ask questions related to the codebase, and the chatbot will generate responses.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `query` function?\n- The `query` function is used to run a chatbot that can answer questions related to a codebase.\n\n2. What is the `vectorStore` variable used for?\n- The `vectorStore` variable is used to store and load embeddings for the chatbot.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `chatHistory` array?\n- The `chatHistory` array is used to keep track of the chat history between the user and the chatbot."
