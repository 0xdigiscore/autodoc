  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for converting JSON files to Markdown format in the Clockwork project. It exports a single function `convertJsonToMarkdown`, which takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input. This object contains the project name, input root directory, and output root directory.\n\nThe function performs two main tasks:\n\n1. Count the number of files in the project:\n\n   It uses the `traverseFileSystem` utility function to traverse the input directory and count the number of files. This is done by providing a `processFile` function that increments the `files` variable for each file encountered.\n\n   ```javascript\n   await traverseFileSystem({\n     inputPath: inputRoot,\n     projectName,\n     processFile: () => {\n       files++;\n       return Promise.resolve();\n     },\n     ignore: [],\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. Create Markdown files for each code file in the project:\n\n   It defines a `processFile` function that reads the content of each JSON file, creates the output directory if it doesn't exist, and then generates the Markdown content based on the JSON data. The Markdown content is then written to a new file with the same name as the input file but with a `.md` extension.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const processFile: ProcessFile = async ({ fileName, filePath }): Promise<void> => {\n     // ...\n     const outputPath = getFileName(markdownFilePath, '.', '.md');\n     await fs.writeFile(outputPath, markdown, 'utf-8');\n   };\n   ```\n\n   The `traverseFileSystem` function is called again with the `processFile` function to create the Markdown files.\n\n   ```javascript\n   updateSpinnerText(`Creating ${files} mardown files...`);\n   await traverseFileSystem({\n     inputPath: inputRoot,\n     projectName,\n     processFile,\n     ignore: [],\n   });\n   spinnerSuccess(`Created ${files} mardown files...`);\n   ```\n\nIn summary, this code is responsible for converting JSON files to Markdown format by traversing the input directory, counting the number of files, and generating Markdown content based on the JSON data. This functionality is essential for creating human-readable documentation from JSON files in the Clockwork project.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** How does the `traverseFileSystem` function work, and what are its parameters?\n   **Answer:** The `traverseFileSystem` function is a utility function that recursively traverses the file system, starting from the given `inputPath`. It takes an object with properties `inputPath`, `projectName`, `processFile`, and `ignore`. The `processFile` property is a callback function that is executed for each file encountered during the traversal.\n\n2. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function, and what does it expect as input?\n   **Answer:** The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is responsible for converting JSON files containing code documentation into Markdown files. It takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input, which contains the properties `name`, `root`, and `output`, representing the project name, input root directory, and output root directory, respectively.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle errors when creating the output directory or writing the Markdown file?\n   **Answer:** The code uses a try-catch block when creating the output directory. If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console and returns early. However, there is a \"TODO\" comment indicating that error handling is not yet implemented when reading the content of the input file."
