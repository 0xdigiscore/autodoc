  "summary": "The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function in the `autodoc` project is responsible for converting JSON files to markdown files. The function takes an object with three properties: `name`, `root`, and `output`. The `name` property is the name of the project, `root` is the root directory of the project, and `output` is the output directory where the markdown files will be created.\n\nThe function first counts the number of files in the project by calling the `traverseFileSystem` function from the `utils` module. The `traverseFileSystem` function recursively traverses the file system and calls the `processFile` function for each file. In this case, the `processFile` function increments the `files` variable for each file it processes.\n\nNext, the function creates a markdown file for each code file in the project by calling `traverseFileSystem` again. This time, the `processFile` function reads the content of the file, creates a markdown file with the same name in the output directory, and writes the markdown content to the file. The markdown content is generated from the JSON content of the file. If the file is a `summary.json` file, the content is parsed as a `FolderSummary` object, otherwise it is parsed as a `FileSummary` object. The `FolderSummary` and `FileSummary` objects have a `summary` property that contains a summary of the file, and an optional `questions` property that contains a list of questions related to the file. The markdown content includes a link to the file on GitHub, the summary, and the questions (if any).\n\nFinally, the function updates the spinner text to indicate that it is creating the markdown files, and then calls `traverseFileSystem` again to create the markdown files. Once all the files have been processed, the function updates the spinner text again to indicate that it has finished creating the markdown files.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger `autodoc` project to generate documentation for a project. The JSON files can be generated automatically by other parts of the project, and then passed to this function to generate the markdown files. The markdown files can then be used to generate HTML or PDF documentation.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function?\n    \n    The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function creates markdown files for each code file in a project, based on the summary and questions provided in JSON files.\n\n2. What is the `traverseFileSystem` function used for in this code?\n    \n    The `traverseFileSystem` function is used twice in this code to iterate through the files and folders in a project directory, and perform a specified action on each file.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getFileName` function?\n    \n    The `getFileName` function is used to modify the file path of a code file to create a corresponding markdown file path, by replacing the file extension with `.md`."
