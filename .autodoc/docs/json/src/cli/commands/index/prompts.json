  "summary": "The code in this file provides three functions for generating prompts and documentation for a code documentation project called autodoc. \n\nThe first function, `createCodeFileSummary`, takes in a file path, project name, and file contents as arguments and returns a string that includes the project name, file path, and file contents. This function is likely used to generate a summary of a specific code file within the project, which can be used to provide context and documentation for that file.\n\nThe second function, `createCodeQuestions`, takes in the same arguments as `createCodeFileSummary` and returns a string that prompts the user to come up with three questions that a developer might have about the code in the file. This function is likely used to encourage critical thinking and analysis of the code, which can lead to more thorough documentation and understanding of the project.\n\nThe third function, `folderSummaryPrompt`, takes in a folder path, project name, an array of file summaries, and an array of folder summaries as arguments and returns a string that includes a summary of the contents of the folder, including the names and summaries of each file and subfolder. This function is likely used to generate a summary of a specific folder within the project, which can be used to provide context and documentation for the files and subfolders within that folder.\n\nOverall, these functions are useful for generating prompts and documentation for a code documentation project, which can help developers understand and navigate the project more easily. Here is an example of how `createCodeFileSummary` might be used:\n\n```\nconst filePath = 'src/components/Button.js';\nconst projectName = 'My Awesome Project';\nconst fileContents = `\n  import React from 'react';\n\n  const Button = ({ text, onClick }) => {\n    return (\n      <button onClick={onClick}>{text}</button>\n    );\n  };\n\n  export default Button;\n`;\n\nconst fileSummary = createCodeFileSummary(filePath, projectName, fileContents);\nconsole.log(fileSummary);\n```\n\nThis would output a string that includes the project name, file path, and file contents, which could be used as documentation for the `Button.js` file in the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createCodeFileSummary` function and what are its parameters?\n- The `createCodeFileSummary` function takes in a file path, project name, and file contents as parameters and returns a string that includes a prompt to write a technical explanation of the code in the file.\n2. What is the purpose of the `createCodeQuestions` function and what are its parameters?\n- The `createCodeQuestions` function takes in a file path, project name, and file contents as parameters and returns a string that includes a prompt to list 3 questions that a super smart developer might have about the code in the file.\n3. What is the purpose of the `folderSummaryPrompt` function and what are its parameters?\n- The `folderSummaryPrompt` function takes in a folder path, project name, an array of file summaries, and an array of folder summaries as parameters and returns a string that includes a prompt to write a technical explanation of the code in the files within the folder and how it fits into the larger project, as well as a summary of the contents of the subfolders."
