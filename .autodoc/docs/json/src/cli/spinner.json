  "summary": "This code is responsible for managing a spinner in the Clockwork project, which is a visual element that indicates a process is running in the background. The spinner is created using the `ora` library, which provides a simple and customizable way to create spinners in the command line interface (CLI).\n\nThe code starts by importing the `ora` library and creating a singleton spinner instance with the 'dots' style. This ensures that there will only be one spinner active at any given time, preventing multiple spinners from overlapping or interfering with each other.\n\nThere are several functions exported for interacting with the spinner:\n\n1. `updateSpinnerText(message: string)`: This function updates the spinner's text with the provided message. If the spinner is already spinning, it simply updates the text; otherwise, it starts the spinner with the new message.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```javascript\n   updateSpinnerText('Loading data...');\n   ```\n\n2. `stopSpinner()`: This function stops the spinner if it is currently spinning.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```javascript\n   stopSpinner();\n   ```\n\n3. `spinnerError(message?: string)`: This function stops the spinner and displays an error message (if provided) with a red \"X\" symbol, indicating that the process has failed.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```javascript\n   spinnerError('Failed to load data');\n   ```\n\n4. `spinnerSuccess(message?: string)`: This function stops the spinner and displays a success message (if provided) with a green checkmark symbol, indicating that the process has completed successfully.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```javascript\n   spinnerSuccess('Data loaded successfully');\n   ```\n\n5. `spinnerInfo(message: string)`: This function displays an informational message with a blue \"i\" symbol, without affecting the spinner's state.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```javascript\n   spinnerInfo('Connecting to server...');\n   ```\n\nThese functions allow the Clockwork project to easily manage the spinner's state and display appropriate messages to the user, providing a better user experience in the CLI.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ora` package in this code?**\n\n   The `ora` package is used to create a spinner in the command line interface, providing a visual indication of a running process. In this code, it is used to create a singleton spinner with the 'dots' style.\n\n2. **What is the purpose of the `updateSpinnerText` function?**\n\n   The `updateSpinnerText` function is used to update the text displayed alongside the spinner. If the spinner is currently spinning, it updates the text; otherwise, it starts the spinner with the new message.\n\n3. **What are the differences between `spinnerError`, `spinnerSuccess`, and `spinnerInfo` functions?**\n\n   These functions are used to display different types of messages alongside the spinner. `spinnerError` displays an error message and stops the spinner with a fail indicator, `spinnerSuccess` displays a success message and stops the spinner with a success indicator, and `spinnerInfo` displays an informational message without stopping the spinner."
