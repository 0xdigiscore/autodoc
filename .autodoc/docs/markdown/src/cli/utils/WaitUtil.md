The `autodoc` project includes a file that contains two functions: `wait` and `forTrue`. These functions are designed to be used in asynchronous programming and can be used to control the flow of execution in a program.

The `wait` function takes two arguments: `timeoutMs` and `value`. The `timeoutMs` argument is a number that represents the amount of time in milliseconds that the function should wait before resolving the promise. The `value` argument is an optional parameter that can be used to resolve the promise with a specific value. If no value is provided, the promise will resolve with `null`.

Here is an example of how the `wait` function can be used:

```
async function example() {
  console.log('start');
  await wait(1000);
  console.log('end');
}

example();
```

In this example, the `example` function will log "start", wait for one second using the `wait` function, and then log "end".

The `forTrue` function takes a single argument: `fn`. `fn` is a function that returns a boolean value. The `forTrue` function will repeatedly call `fn` every 50 milliseconds until it returns `true`. If `fn` does not return `true` within 10 seconds (200 * 50 milliseconds), the promise will be rejected.

Here is an example of how the `forTrue` function can be used:

```
async function example() {
  const result = await forTrue(() => {
    const random = Math.random();
    console.log(random);
    return random > 0.9;
  });
  console.log(result);
}

example();
```

In this example, the `example` function will repeatedly log a random number between 0 and 1 every 50 milliseconds until a number greater than 0.9 is generated. Once a number greater than 0.9 is generated, the `forTrue` function will resolve the promise with `true` and the `example` function will log `true`.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `wait` function do and what are its parameters?
- The `wait` function is an asynchronous function that returns a promise. It takes in a `timeoutMs` parameter, which is the time in milliseconds to wait before resolving the promise, and an optional `value` parameter, which is the value to be resolved with.

2. What does the `forTrue` function do and what is its parameter?
- The `forTrue` function is an asynchronous function that returns a promise. It takes in a `fn` parameter, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The function repeatedly calls `fn` every 50 milliseconds until it returns `true`, or until it has been called 200 times, at which point it rejects the promise.

3. Are there any potential issues with the `count` variable in the `forTrue` function?
- Yes, there is a potential issue with the `count` variable in the `forTrue` function. It is currently initialized to 0 every time the function is called, so it will never reach the threshold of 200 and reject the promise. It should be declared outside of the function and incremented each time the function is called.
