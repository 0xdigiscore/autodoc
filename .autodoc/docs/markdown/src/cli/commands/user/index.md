The `autodoc` project is a tool for generating documentation from code. This file contains code for handling user configuration of the tool. 

The `makeConfigTemplate` function takes an optional `config` object and returns a new `AutodocUserConfig` object. If `config` is provided, the `llms` property of the new object is set to the value of `config.llms`. Otherwise, the `llms` property is set to an array containing the `LLMModels.GPT3` value.

The `user` function is an asynchronous function that takes an optional `config` object as an argument. If a user configuration file already exists at `userConfigFilePath`, the function prompts the user to confirm whether they want to overwrite the existing file. If the user chooses not to continue, the function exits. Otherwise, the function creates the directory containing the configuration file if it does not already exist.

The function then prompts the user to select which LLMs they have access to using the `inquirer` library. The choices are presented as a list of options, each with a name and a value. The `llms` property of the `config` object is set to the selected value.

The `newConfig` object is created by calling `makeConfigTemplate` with the updated `llms` property and the rest of the properties from the original `config` object. The `newConfig` object is then written to the user configuration file using the `fs` library.

Finally, a success message is printed to the console.

This code can be used to handle user configuration of the `autodoc` tool. The `makeConfigTemplate` function can be used to create a default configuration object, and the `user` function can be called to prompt the user to select which LLMs they have access to and write the resulting configuration to a file. The `userConfigFilePath` and `userConfigFileName` constants are used to specify the location and name of the configuration file, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `makeConfigTemplate` function?
- The `makeConfigTemplate` function returns an `AutodocUserConfig` object with default values for the `llms` property, and accepts an optional `config` parameter to override the default values.

2. What is the purpose of the `user` function?
- The `user` function prompts the user to select which LLMs they have access to, creates a new `AutodocUserConfig` object with the selected LLMs, and saves it to a JSON file at `userConfigFilePath`.

3. What is the purpose of the `const.js` and `types.js` files?
- The `const.js` file exports the `userConfigFileName` and `userConfigFilePath` constants used in the `user` function, while the `types.js` file exports the `AutodocUserConfig` and `LLMModels` types used throughout the `autodoc` project.
