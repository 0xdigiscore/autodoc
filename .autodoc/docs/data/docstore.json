This file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, description, and dependencies. It also specifies the build and development scripts, as well as the project's configuration for the Prettier code formatter.\n\nThe main entry point for the project is `index.js`, and the build script uses `esbuild` to bundle the TypeScript source code located in `src/index.ts` into a CommonJS module, outputting the result to `dist/index.js`. The `start` script first runs the build process and then executes the generated `index.js` file. The `dev` script builds the project and installs it globally on the user's system.\n\nThe `bin` field specifies that the project exposes a command-line tool named `autodoc`, which can be executed by running `./dist/index.js`. This tool is likely used for generating documentation for the larger Clockwork project.\n\nThe project has several dependencies, including:\n\n- `@dqbd/tiktoken`: A library for tokenizing text.\n- `chalk`: A library for styling console output.\n- `cli-progress`: A library for creating progress bars in the command line.\n- `commander`: A library for creating command-line interfaces.\n- `figlet`: A library for creating ASCII art text.\n- `hnswlib-node`: A library for approximate nearest neighbor search.\n- `istextorbinary`: A library for determining if a file is text or binary.\n- `langchain`: A library for language modeling and text generation.\n- `minimatch`: A library for matching file paths against patterns.\n- `ora`: A library for creating elegant terminal spinners.\n\nThe project also has several development dependencies, such as TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier, which are used for code formatting, linting, and type checking during development.\n\nOverall, this `package.json` file sets up a Node.js project that provides a command-line tool for generating documentation, likely for the Clockwork project. The tool uses various libraries for text processing, console output formatting, and file handling.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this project?**\n\n   The project is named `@context-labs/autodoc` with a description of \"autodoc\". It seems to be a tool for automatically generating documentation, but more context or a README file would be helpful to understand its specific use case and functionality.\n\n2. **How can I use this project as a command line tool?**\n\n   The `bin` field in the package.json file specifies that the command line tool can be invoked using the `autodoc` command. After installing the package globally with `npm install -g .`, you can use the `autodoc` command to run the tool.\n\n3. **What build system and language is this project using?**\n\n   The project is using `esbuild` as its build system, as specified in the `scripts` field, and it appears to be written in TypeScript, given the presence of TypeScript-related dependencies and the `src/index.ts` file mentioned in the build script.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/package.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/commands/index/convertJsonToMarkdown.ts)\n\nThe code in this file is responsible for converting JSON files to Markdown format in the Clockwork project. It exports a single function `convertJsonToMarkdown`, which takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input. This object contains the project name, input root directory, and output root directory.\n\nThe function performs two main tasks:\n\n1. Count the number of files in the project:\n\n   It uses the `traverseFileSystem` utility function to traverse the input directory and count the number of files. This is done by providing a `processFile` function that increments the `files` variable for each file encountered.\n\n   ```javascript\n   await traverseFileSystem({\n     inputPath: inputRoot,\n     projectName,\n     processFile: () => {\n       files++;\n       return Promise.resolve();\n     },\n     ignore: [],\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. Create Markdown files for each code file in the project:\n\n   It defines a `processFile` function that reads the content of each JSON file, creates the output directory if it doesn't exist, and then generates the Markdown content based on the JSON data. The Markdown content is then written to a new file with the same name as the input file but with a `.md` extension.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const processFile: ProcessFile = async ({ fileName, filePath }): Promise<void> => {\n     // ...\n     const outputPath = getFileName(markdownFilePath, '.', '.md');\n     await fs.writeFile(outputPath, markdown, 'utf-8');\n   };\n   ```\n\n   The `traverseFileSystem` function is called again with the `processFile` function to create the Markdown files.\n\n   ```javascript\n   updateSpinnerText(`Creating ${files} mardown files...`);\n   await traverseFileSystem({\n     inputPath: inputRoot,\n     projectName,\n     processFile,\n     ignore: [],\n   });\n   spinnerSuccess(`Created ${files} mardown files...`);\n   ```\n\nIn summary, this code is responsible for converting JSON files to Markdown format by traversing the input directory, counting the number of files, and generating Markdown content based on the JSON data. This functionality is essential for creating human-readable documentation from JSON files in the Clockwork project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** How does the `traverseFileSystem` function work, and what are its parameters?\n   **Answer:** The `traverseFileSystem` function is a utility function that recursively traverses the file system, starting from the given `inputPath`. It takes an object with properties `inputPath`, `projectName`, `processFile`, and `ignore`. The `processFile` property is a callback function that is executed for each file encountered during the traversal.\n\n2. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function, and what does it expect as input?\n   **Answer:** The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is responsible for converting JSON files containing code documentation into Markdown files. It takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input, which contains the properties `name`, `root`, and `output`, representing the project name, input root directory, and output root directory, respectively.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle errors when creating the output directory or writing the Markdown file?\n   **Answer:** The code uses a try-catch block when creating the output directory. If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console and returns early. However, there is a \"TODO\" comment indicating that error handling is not yet implemented when reading the content of the input file.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/commands/index/convertJsonToMarkdown.md"}}],["2",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/commands/index/createVectorStore.ts)\n\nThe code in this file is responsible for processing a directory of text files, splitting the text into chunks, and creating a vector store using the processed documents. The vector store is then saved to a specified output location.\n\nThe `processFile` function reads the content of a file and creates a `Document` object with the file contents and metadata. The `processDirectory` function recursively processes a directory and its subdirectories, creating an array of `Document` objects.\n\nThe `RepoLoader` class extends the `BaseDocumentLoader` class and implements the `load` method, which returns an array of `Document` objects by calling the `processDirectory` function.\n\nThe `fromDocuments` function takes an array of `Document` objects, an `Embeddings` object, and an optional configuration object. It creates an instance of `HNSWLib` with the provided embeddings and configuration, adds the documents to the instance, and returns it.\n\nThe `createVectorStore` function is exported and serves as the main entry point for this module. It takes an `AutodocConfig` object with `root` and `output` properties. The function creates a `RepoLoader` instance with the `root` path, loads the documents, and splits them into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class. It then creates a vector store using the `fromDocuments` function with the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class, and saves the vector store to the specified `output` path.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createVectorStore } from 'clockwork';\n\nconst config = {\n  root: './path/to/text/files',\n  output: './path/to/vector/store',\n};\n\ncreateVectorStore(config).then(() => {\n  console.log('Vector store created and saved successfully.');\n});\n```\n\nIn the larger project, this code can be used to process a collection of text files, generate embeddings for the text chunks, and create a searchable vector store that can be used for tasks like document similarity, clustering, or information retrieval.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `processFile` function and how does it handle errors?\n   **Answer**: The `processFile` function reads the content of a file and creates a `Document` object with the file contents and metadata. If there is an error while reading the file, it rejects the promise with the error.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `processDirectory` function handle nested directories and files?\n   **Answer**: The `processDirectory` function iterates through the files in a directory. If it encounters a subdirectory, it calls itself recursively to process the files within the subdirectory. If it encounters a file, it processes the file using the `processFile` function and adds the resulting `Document` object to the `docs` array.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `fromDocuments` function and how does it use the `Embeddings` parameter?\n   **Answer**: The `fromDocuments` function creates an instance of `HNSWLib` using the provided `Embeddings` object and adds the given documents to the instance. The `Embeddings` parameter is used to specify the embeddings implementation (e.g., `OpenAIEmbeddings`) that will be used by the `HNSWLib` instance for vector operations.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/commands/index/createVectorStore.md"}}],["3",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/commands/index/index.ts)\n\nThe code in this file is responsible for processing a given repository and generating documentation in JSON, Markdown, and vector formats. It does this by utilizing three main functions: `processRepository`, `convertJsonToMarkdown`, and `createVectorStore`. These functions are called sequentially within the exported `index` function, which takes an `AutodocConfig` object as its argument.\n\nFirst, the `index` function initializes the paths for JSON, Markdown, and data (vector) outputs. These paths are constructed using the `output` property from the `AutodocConfig` object and the respective subdirectories: 'docs/json/', 'docs/markdown/', and 'docs/data/'.\n\nNext, the `processRepository` function is called with the necessary configuration properties. This function traverses the repository, calls the LLMS (Language-agnostic Linting and Modularization System) for each file, and creates JSON files with the results. The spinner text is updated to indicate the current progress, and upon completion, the spinner is marked as successful.\n\nFollowing this, the `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is called to create Markdown files from the generated JSON files. The spinner text is updated again to reflect the current task, and the function is called with the appropriate configuration properties. Once the conversion is complete, the spinner is marked as successful.\n\nFinally, the `createVectorStore` function is called to create vector files from the generated Markdown files. The spinner text is updated once more to indicate the current progress, and the function is called with the necessary configuration properties.\n\nIn summary, this code is responsible for processing a repository and generating documentation in various formats. It does so by calling three main functions in sequence, updating the spinner text to indicate progress, and marking the spinner as successful upon completion of each task. This file is likely used in the larger project to automate the generation of documentation for a given repository.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `index` function and what are its input parameters?**\n\n   The `index` function is the main entry point for the clockwork project, which takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input. This object contains properties such as `name`, `repositoryUrl`, `root`, `output`, `llms`, and `ignore`.\n\n2. **What is the role of the `processRepository` function and what are its input parameters?**\n\n   The `processRepository` function is responsible for traversing the repository, calling LLMS for each file, and creating JSON files with the results. It takes an object with properties such as `name`, `repositoryUrl`, `root`, `output`, `llms`, and `ignore`.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `convertJsonToMarkdown` and `createVectorStore` functions, and what are their input parameters?**\n\n   The `convertJsonToMarkdown` function is responsible for creating markdown files from JSON files, while the `createVectorStore` function is responsible for creating vector files. Both functions take an object with properties such as `name`, `repositoryUrl`, `root`, `output`, `llms`, and `ignore`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/commands/index/index.md"}}],["4",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/commands/index/processRepository.ts)\n\nThe `processRepository` function in this code is designed to generate documentation for a given code repository. It takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input, which contains information about the project name, repository URL, input and output directories, language model, and files/folders to ignore.\n\nThe function uses the `traverseFileSystem` utility to iterate through the files and folders in the input directory. For each file, it reads the content, generates a summary and a list of questions using the `createCodeFileSummary` and `createCodeQuestions` functions, and then calls the language model to generate the documentation. The generated documentation is then saved as a JSON file in the output directory.\n\nFor each folder, the function reads the summaries of all the files and subfolders within it, and then calls the language model to generate a summary for the folder itself. This summary is saved as a `summary.json` file in the folder.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. Count the number of files and folders in the project using `filesAndFolders` function.\n2. Update the spinner text to show the progress of processing files.\n3. Traverse the file system and process each file using the `processFile` function.\n4. Update the spinner text to show the progress of processing folders.\n5. Traverse the file system and process each folder using the `processFolder` function.\n6. Stop the spinner and print the model details.\n\nThe code also handles API rate limiting using the `APIRateLimit` utility and selects the appropriate language model based on the input length. The generated documentation can be used in the larger project to provide an overview and understanding of the codebase.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `processRepository` function and what are its input parameters?\n   \n   **Answer:** The `processRepository` function is responsible for processing a given repository, generating summaries and questions for each code file and folder in the project. It takes an `AutodocConfig` object as input, which includes the project name, repository URL, input and output paths, LLM models, and an ignore list.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `callLLM` function work and what is the purpose of the `APIRateLimit` class?\n\n   **Answer:** The `callLLM` function is an asynchronous function that takes a prompt and an LLM model as input, and calls the LLM model API with the given prompt. The `APIRateLimit` class is used to limit the number of API calls to a specified rate (in this case, 25) to avoid exceeding the API rate limit.\n\n3. **Question:** How are the summaries and questions generated for each file and folder in the project?\n\n   **Answer:** The summaries and questions are generated using the `createCodeFileSummary`, `createCodeQuestions`, and `folderSummaryPrompt` functions, which create prompts based on the project name, file or folder content, and other relevant information. These prompts are then passed to the LLM models to generate the summaries and questions.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/commands/index/processRepository.md"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/commands/index/prompts.ts)\n\nThis code file provides three utility functions that generate prompts for code documentation tasks.

Once the call is completed, it decrements the `inProgress` counter and calls `dequeueAndExecute` again to check for any remaining calls in the queue.\n\nHere's an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nconst apiRateLimiter = new APIRateLimit(10); // Limit to 10 concurrent calls\n\nasync function fetchData(id) {\n  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data/${id}`);\n  return response.json();\n}\n\nasync function getData(ids) {\n  const results = await Promise.all(ids.map(id => apiRateLimiter.callApi(() => fetchData(id))));\n  return results;\n}\n\ngetData([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `APIRateLimit` class is used to limit the number of concurrent calls to the `fetchData` function, which fetches data from an API. The `getData` function takes an array of IDs and uses `Promise.all` to wait for all the API calls to complete before returning the results.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `APIRateLimit` class and how does it work?\n   **Answer:** The `APIRateLimit` class is designed to limit the number of concurrent API calls to a specified maximum. It maintains a queue of API calls and executes them when there are available slots for concurrent calls, ensuring that the number of in-progress calls does not exceed the specified limit.\n\n2. **Question:** How can the `maxConcurrentCalls` parameter be customized when creating an instance of the `APIRateLimit` class?\n   **Answer:** The `maxConcurrentCalls` parameter can be customized by passing a value to the constructor when creating a new instance of the `APIRateLimit` class. If no value is provided, the default value of 50 will be used.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the `callApi` method handle errors that occur during the execution of the provided `apiFunction`?\n   **Answer:** The `callApi` method uses a try-catch block to handle errors that occur during the execution of the `apiFunction`. If an error is caught, the promise returned by `callApi` will be rejected with the caught error.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/utils/APIRateLimit.md"}}],["11",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/utils/FileUtil.ts)\n\nThe code in this file provides utility functions for handling file and folder paths in the Clockwork project.

It returns a new string with the given extension. If the delimiter is not found in the input string, the function appends the extension to the input string. If the delimiter is found, the function replaces the part of the input string after the last occurrence of the delimiter with the extension.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const fileName = getFileName(\"example.txt\", \".\", \".md\");\n   // fileName will be \"example.md\"\n   ```\n\n2. `githubFileUrl(githubRoot, inputRoot, filePath)`: This function takes three string arguments: the root URL of a GitHub repository, the root path of the input files, and the file path relative to the input root. It returns a string containing the URL to access the file in the GitHub repository.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const fileUrl = githubFileUrl(\"https://github.com/user/repo\", \"src\", \"src/example.md\");\n   // fileUrl will be \"https://github.com/user/repo/blob/master/example.md\"\n   ```\n\n3. `githubFolderUrl(githubRoot, inputRoot, folderPath)`: This function is similar to `githubFileUrl`, but it generates URLs for folders instead of files.

If the delimiter is not found, it appends the extension to the input string.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `githubFileUrl` function work and what are its expected inputs?\n   **Answer:** The `githubFileUrl` function takes three input parameters: `githubRoot`, `inputRoot`, and `filePath`. It returns a string representing the URL of a file in a GitHub repository. The function concatenates the `githubRoot` with the `/blob/master/` path and the `filePath` substring starting from the index of `inputRoot.length - 1`.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the difference between the `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions, and how do they handle the input parameters?\n   **Answer:** Both `githubFileUrl` and `githubFolderUrl` functions generate URLs for GitHub repository items, but `githubFileUrl` generates a URL for a file, while `githubFolderUrl` generates a URL for a folder. They both take the same input parameters (`githubRoot`, `inputRoot`, and `folderPath` or `filePath`) and handle them similarly, but the `githubFolderUrl` function concatenates the `githubRoot` with the `/tree/master/` path instead of `/blob/master/` used in `githubFileUrl`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/utils/FileUtil.md"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/blob/master/src/cli/utils/LLMUtil.ts)\n\nThis code defines and manages different language models (LLMs) used in the Clockwork project. It imports the `OpenAIChat` class from the `langchain/llms` package and the `LLMModelDetails` and `LLMModels` types from the `../../types` module.\n\nThe `models` object contains three LLMs: GPT3, GPT4, and GPT432k. Each model has a set of properties, such as its name, input and output costs per 1,000 tokens, maximum token length, and an instance of the `OpenAIChat` class with the corresponding model name and API key. Additionally, each model has counters for input and output tokens, succeeded and failed requests, and the total number of requests.\n\nThe `printModelDetails` function takes an array of `LLMModelDetails` and prints a summary table to the console. It first maps the input models to an output array containing the model name, file count, succeeded and failed requests, total tokens, and cost. Then, it calculates the totals for each property by reducing the output array. Finally, it adds the totals to the output array and prints the resulting table using `console.table`.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to manage and track the usage of different LLMs. For example, it can help monitor the costs associated with each model and provide insights into their performance. To use this code, one can import the `models` object and the `printModelDetails` function, and then interact with the LLMs through their `llm` property:\n\n```javascript\nimport { models, printModelDetails } from './clockwork';\n\n// Use GPT3 model for a chat request\nmodels[LLMModels.GPT3].llm.chat('What is the meaning of life?');\n\n// Print the model details\nprintModelDetails(Object.values(models));\n```\n\nThis will send a chat request using the GPT3 model and then print the details of all the models, including the updated usage statistics.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `models` object and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer:** The `models` object is a record that maps the `LLMModels` enum values to their respective `LLMModelDetails`. It contains information about each model, such as its name, input and output costs, maximum token length, and an instance of the `OpenAIChat` class with the corresponding model configuration.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `printModelDetails` function work and what is its output?\n   **Answer:** The `printModelDetails` function takes an array of `LLMModelDetails` as input and generates a summary of the model usage statistics, such as the number of files processed, succeeded, failed, total tokens, and cost. It then prints this summary in a tabular format using `console.table`.\n\n3. **Question:** In the `LLMModels.GPT432k` configuration, the `modelName` property is set to `LLMModels.GPT4`.

These functions return Promises, which are a standard way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.\n\n### wait function\n\nThe `wait` function is an asynchronous function that takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the Promise, and `value`, which is an optional value to be returned when the Promise resolves. The default value for `value` is `null`.\n\nThis function can be used to introduce a delay in the execution of asynchronous code. For example, if you want to wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) before executing the next line of code, you can use the `wait` function as follows:\n\n```javascript\nawait wait(1000);\nconsole.log(\"This will be printed after 1 second\");\n```\n\n### forTrue function\n\nThe `forTrue` function is another asynchronous utility function that takes a single argument, `fn`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The purpose of this function is to repeatedly check the result of the `fn` function every 50 milliseconds, up to a maximum of 200 times. If the `fn` function returns `true` at any point during this process, the Promise resolves with the value `true`. If the `fn` function never returns `true` after 200 checks, the Promise is rejected.\n\nThis function can be used to wait for a specific condition to become true before proceeding with the execution of asynchronous code. For example, if you have a function `isDataReady` that returns `true` when some data is ready to be processed, you can use the `forTrue` function as follows:\n\n```javascript\nawait forTrue(isDataReady);\nconsole.log(\"Data is ready, proceed with processing\");\n```\n\nIn summary, this file provides two utility functions that help manage asynchronous operations in the Clockwork project by introducing delays and waiting for specific conditions to be met.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `wait` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer:** The `wait` function is an asynchronous utility function that resolves a promise after a specified timeout in milliseconds. It takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait, and an optional `value` to be resolved with the promise.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `forTrue` function work and what is its use case?\n   **Answer:** The `forTrue` function is an asynchronous utility function that repeatedly checks if a given function `fn` returns `true`. It resolves a promise when the function returns `true` or rejects the promise if the function does not return `true` after 200 attempts with a 50ms interval between each attempt.\n\n3. **Question:** Why is the `count` variable initialized to 0 in the `forTrue` function but never incremented?\n   **Answer:** It seems to be a mistake in the code. The `count` variable should be incremented within the `setInterval` callback to keep track of the number of attempts made to check if the function `fn` returns `true`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/cli/utils/WaitUtil.md"}}],["14",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/context-labs/autodoc/tree/master/.autodoc/docs/json/src/cli/utils)\n\nThe code in this folder provides utility functions and classes to manage various aspects of the Clockwork project, such as rate limiting API calls, handling file and folder paths, managing language models, and traversing file systems.\n\n`APIRateLimit.ts` contains the `APIRateLimit` class, which manages and limits the number of concurrent API calls made by the application.

If it doesn't exist, an error message is displayed and the function returns. It then defines a `shouldIgnore` function that checks if a given file or folder name matches any pattern in the `ignore` array using the `minimatch` library.\n\nThe main logic of the function is implemented in the `dfs` (depth-first search) function. It reads the contents of the current path using `fs.readdir`, filters out any ignored files or folders, and processes the remaining entries. For each entry, it checks if it's a directory or a file. If it's a directory, it recursively calls the `dfs` function on the subdirectory and then processes the folder using the `processFolder` callback.

This is important because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and it needs to be compiled down to JavaScript before it can be executed in a runtime environment.\n\nThe configuration file is written in JSON format and contains a single object with a key called `compilerOptions`. This key holds an object with several properties that define the behavior of the TypeScript compiler:\n\n- `rootDir`: Specifies the root directory of the source code, which is set to \"src\". This is where the TypeScript files are located.\n- `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files, which is set to \"dist\". This is where the transpiled JavaScript files will be saved.\n- `strict`: Enables strict type checking, which helps catch potential type-related errors during the development process.\n- `target`: Sets the target ECMAScript version for the output JavaScript code, which is set to \"es6\". This means the compiled code will be compatible with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) environments.\n- `module`: Specifies the module system to be used, which is set to \"commonjs\". This is a widely used module system in the Node.js ecosystem.\n- `sourceMap`: Generates source map files, which help in debugging the compiled JavaScript code by mapping it back to the original TypeScript source code.\n- `esModuleInterop`: Enables better compatibility between CommonJS and ES modules by creating a namespace object for imported CommonJS modules.\n- `moduleResolution`: Specifies the module resolution strategy, which is set to \"node\". This means the compiler will follow the Node.js module resolution algorithm when resolving module imports.\n\nOverall, this configuration file plays a crucial role in the Clockwork project by defining how the TypeScript compiler should process the source code and generate the final JavaScript output.
